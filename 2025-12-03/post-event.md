- Good attendance boldtsered by CDT students.
- Such good attendance that we nearly had different people working on the same issue.
- 13:30 - 15:48 😞 would have been nice to go longer?

## Attendees

- Total 22
- 6 helpers from ARC.

## Format

Sam gave light intro slides, should remember David's point "don't be worried if your PR is open for a while".
After about 45 minutes, check in to make sure everyone had managed to _find_ an issue and had someone to work with.

## Good

Small group and enough helpers to pair up!
Short slides are better than long slides.
The "Outcomes" issue worked well.

## Lessons learned / things to remember for next time

- Book the room ourselves and leave at least an hour overtime.
- Tagging on with CDT was good for attendance.
- Need to find some way to organise many people interested in one ticket.
  - Tables per language? Topic? Theme?
  - Icebreaker?the 
- Need to remember to check the ARC website and LinkedIn adverts (LinkedIn post had the wrong URL link for ages).
- If one Googles "Winter ARC Good First Issue Hackathon", the top result is last year's event: push for a new event post or call the event something else!
