Have you always wanted to contribute to open source, but never had the push to start?

Join [ARC](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc) and the [CCMI-CDT](https://ccmi-cdt.org/) for the Winter Open-source good-first issue hackathon! 
It’s a hackathon but where we pair up and each tackle a good first issue from an open-source project that we’re interested in contributing to. 
No idea what to work on? No problem, come anyway and pair up with someone who does. 
Never contributed to an open-source project before? No problem, we’ll have some experienced contributors on hand to advise on pull-request etiquette and workflows.
