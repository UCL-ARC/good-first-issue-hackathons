- Small workshop in a larger event.
- 13:30 - 14:35 (1 hr workshop but interrupted after 40 mins due to room booking).

## Attendees

- Total 11 (ish)
- 6 helpers from ARC and SWC.
- Everyone had someone to pair with.

## Format

Sam gave intro slides, after some time David walked though fixing a very easy issue in Matplotlib docs as a good template for the `git` commands.

## Good

Small group and enough helpers to pair up!

## Bad

- Roombooking fail!
- 45 minutes seems really not long enough.
