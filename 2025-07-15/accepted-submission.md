## Abstract

Many of the software and tools we use every day in our research are open-source community projects. Can you imagine doing a data science project without Pandas or R? Could you imagine making plots and visualisations without Matplotlib or Plotly? Could you imagine writing a paper without LaTeX or Overleaf?

These and many other cornerstones of research software are all open-source and community-driven. They rely on bug reports and fixes from a community of volunteers and researchers.

**This workshop is a hands-on introduction to making contributions to open source software.** We'll take you through the steps of identifying a project you rely on, finding a "good first issue" and making your first contribution; be that a pull request, bug report, or simply an improvement to some documentation. Contributing to open-source software projects is a great way to give back to the scientific research software community, build your coding skills, and gain recognition. 

We'll be coding together in small groups and there will be experienced open-source contributors from UCL on hand to help guide you through. Want to come but no idea what to contribute to?! There'll be a curated list of "good first issue"s from projects we maintain or frequently contribute to so you can get stuck in!

## Resources needed

- A laptop, code editor, `git` and a GitHub account.
- Some familiarity with `git` is beneficial but not mandatory; not all contributions are code!

## How you plan to recruit participants

Advertising session on UCL research programming hub, some direct invitations to interested parties from the last time we ran this. ISD mailing list (TBC).
