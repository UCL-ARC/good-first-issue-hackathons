# Good First Issue Hackathons and Workshops

[UCL-ARC] organises "Good first issue" hackathons and workshops to help UCL staff and students, who are curious about open source software, to make their first contribution!

[UCL-ARC]: https://ucl.ac.uk/arc

This repository contains material we've used before and some lessons learned from previous workshops.
Admin tasks for organising future workshops and hackathons can be organised by [issues] raised against this repository.
All material, [issues], and [project boards] are public.
