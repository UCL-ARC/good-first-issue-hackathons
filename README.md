# Good First Issue Hackathons and Workshops

[UCL-ARC] organises "Good first issue" hackathons and workshops to help UCL staff and students, who are curious about open source software, to make their first contribution!

This repository contains material we've used before and some lessons learned from previous workshops.
Admin tasks for organising future workshops and hackathons can be organised by [issues] raised against this repository.
All material, [issues], and [project boards] are public.
